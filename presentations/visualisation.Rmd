```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(agridat)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(png)
data <- read_csv("../data/datasets.csv")
data_12 <- data %>% 
  filter(dataset != 4)
data <- data %>%
  filter(dataset == 4)
comb2pngs <- function(imgs, bottom_text = NULL){
  img1 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[1])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)
  img2 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[2])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)
  grid.arrange(img1, img2, ncol = 2, bottom = bottom_text)
}
```

## Why visualisation?

Let's meet a dataset:

```{r intro}
data
```


Let's get an idea of its structure:

```{r summary}
summary(data)
```

One little scatterplot:

```{r scatter, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

Some more examples of why data visualisation is so valuable:

[The datasaur dozen](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats]. ) group of 12 two-dimensional datasets that have identical:

* mean in both dimensions
* sd in both dimensions
* correlation between x and y



**But...**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


```{r scatter12, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data_12, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dataset)
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


## The roles of data visualisation 

In general there are two purposes behind data visualisations:

* As a discovery tool, to explore a dataset
* As a storytelling tool, to highlight features of a dataset

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

> In both cases, successful visualisation will 
> illuminate and aid understanding, 
> not confuse or obscure.

## Exercise - What is a data visualisation?

What is the difference between panel E and the other panels in the following figure?

<img src="figure/diagram_plot.PNG" alt="Plot vs diagram" style="width: 600px;"/>


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Straight to a classic

&nbsp;

![](figure/minard.jpg)

### Exercise:

- What are the data elements contributing to this plot?
- How are they each visually represented?


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## A modern example

![](figure/mayer2017.PNG)

### Exercise:

- How are the data elements linked to visual elements?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Another example
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
p2 <- p1 +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10(
    breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),
   labels = scales::trans_format("log10", scales::math_format(10^.x))
  ) + annotation_logticks()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

### Exercise:

Compare the two plots above
- How are the data elements linked to the visual elements?
- What is the difference between the two?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=15, cache=FALSE}
harris.multi.uniformity %>% 
  filter(crop %in% c("barley", "straw"),
         year > 1917) %>% 
  group_by(year, crop) %>% 
  summarise(mean_yield = mean(yield)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) -> dat_sum
p1 <- ggplot(dat_sum, aes(year, mean_yield, fill = crop, colour = crop, group = crop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")

p2 <- ggplot(dat_sum, aes(year, mean_yield, fill = crop, colour = crop, group = crop)) +
  geom_line()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

### Exercise:

Compare the two plots above
- How are the data elements linked to the visual elements?
- What is the difference between the two?

## Considerations for quality graphs:

### Ink to information ratio

Compare the amount of ink used with the amount of information communicated. A high ink:information can indicate a plot that hasn't been thought through, and is often distracting or confusing. 

These plots often contain 'chart junk' (Edward Tufte).


&nbsp;

<img src="figure/high-ink.PNG" width="425"/> <img src="figure/low-ink.PNG" width="425"/> 

## Exercise

Compare the above figure. 
- Which elements are removed in the left version?
- Which elements could still be removed? What is their purpose?

## Some common errors in visualisation


### Overplotting

When there are too many data points...

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10()
```


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Exercise

- What are some possible solutions to overplotting?


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Transparency

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

### Binning

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

### Jittering

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) +
  geom_point()
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
